# Sample-specific-difference-network
Abundant and multi-dimensional datasets generated from cancer-related projects have presented great challenges and opportunities, which are contributed to unfold the complexity of diseases. Discovery of systematic and effective module biomarkers or genes sets play an important role in personalized therapy and precision treatment of cancer. However, there is no efficient way to assess whether the specific networks based on different standards have systematically correspondence. In this study, we developed a statistical method, i.e. a sample-specific difference network (SSN), to analyze the similarity of standard based on genes molecular expression of a single person, which also be verified by gastric cancer progression from GEO datasets. We constructed SSN for each sample and our results demonstrate its application to characterize complex disease at the single-sample level. SSN can also be used to identify patient-specific disease modules as well as driver genes. In particular, the results of survival analysis manifest these driver genes can be used independently as individual module biomarker by using the Cancer Genome Atlas data for various cancer.
